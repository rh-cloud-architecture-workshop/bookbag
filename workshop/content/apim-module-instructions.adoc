//== Deploy the Contract First Module

//TODO: deploy the solution through BackStage


== Objectives

Here is an outline of the activities you will achieve as part of this module.

.Activities overview
image::images/apim/apim-overview-flowchart.png[]


== Setup OpenShift Dev Spaces 
You are going to use *OpenShift Dev Spaces* for a number of activities. OpenShift Dev Spaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration development environment, accessible from a browser window.

=== Section Goals
* Access OpenShift Dev Spaces as *{user_name}*
* Ensure you are logged in to OpenShift as *{user_name}* 

=== Instructions
* In a browser window, navigate to the browser tab pointing to the Developer perspective of the OpenShift cluster. If you don't have a browser tab open on the console, click on {openshift_cluster_console}[OpenShift Console^, window="console"] to launch the console. If needed login with your username and password ({user_name}/{user_password}).

* On the top menu of the console, click on the image:images/openshift-application-menu.png[] icon, and in the drop-down box, select *Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*.
+
.Access Red Hat Devspace
image::images/openshift-application-menu-2.png[]

* Login in with your OpenShift credentials ({user_name}/{user_password}). If this is the first time you access Dev Spaces, you have to authorize Dev Spaces to access your account. In the _Authorize Access_ window click on *Allow selected permissions*. 
+
.Red Hat Devspace - Allow selected permissions
image::images/devspace-auth-access.png[width=70%]

* You are directed to the Dev Spaces overview page, which shows the workspaces you have access to. You should see a single workspace, called *cloud-architecture-workshop*. The workspace needs a couple of seconds to start up.
+
.Red Hat Devspace - cloud-architecture-workshop
image::images/devspaces-workspace-starting.png[]

* Click on the *Open* link of the workspace.
+
.Red Hat Devspace - Open cloud-architecture-workshop
image::images/devspaces-workspace-started-1.png[]

* This opens the workspace, which will look pretty familiar if you are used to working with VS Code. Before opening the workspace, a pop-up might appear asking if you trust the contents of the workspace. Click *Yes, I trust the authors* to continue.
+
.Red Hat Devspace - Agree to trust the authors
image::images/devspaces-trust-contents.png[]

* The workspace contains all the resources you are going to use during the workshop. In the project explorer on the left of the workspace, open the *workshop/module-apim* folder as shown in the screenshot below
+
.Red Hat Devspace - API Module
image::images/apim/apim-devspaces.png[] 

* You can deploy the various resources needed in this workshop to the OpenShift cluster directly from Dev Spaces. To do so, you will need access to the built-in *Terminal*. Click on the image:images/devspaces-menu.png[] icon on the top of the left menu, and select *Terminal -> New Terminal* from the drop-down menu.
+
.Red Hat Devspace - New terminal
image::images/apim/apim-devspaces-menu-new-terminal.png[]

* This opens a terminal in the bottom half of the workspace.
+
.Red Hat Devspace - Open terminal
image::images/apim/apim-devspaces-menu-terminal.png[]

* The OpenShift Dev Spaces environment has access to a plethora of command line tools, including *oc*, the OpenShift command line interface. Through OpenShift Dev Spaces you are automatically logged in into the OpenShift cluster. You can verify this with the command *oc whoami*.
+

[source,bash,role=copy, subs="attributes"]
----
oc whoami
----
+

.Output
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
{user_name}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the output of the `oc whoami` command does not correspond to your username ({user_name}), you need to logout and login again with the correct username.

[source, bash, role=copy, subs="attributes"]
----
oc logout
oc login -u {user_name} -p {user_password} {openshift_api_internal}
----

====

* You will be working in the `globex-apim-{user_name}` namespace. So run this following command to start using that particular project

+
[source,bash,role=copy, subs="attributes"]
----
oc project globex-apim-{user_name}
----


+
.Red Hat Devspace - Verify that you are using the globex-apim-<username> namespace
image::images/apim/apim-terminal-setup.png[width=70%]

* Keep this browser tab open because you will referring to draft content, scripts and YAML files for creating objects on OpenShift

=== Scratchpad
As you work through this Contract First APIs module, there are a few variables and URLs that are needed throughout this activity. To make things easier and manageable we've setup a scratchpad within Dev Spaces. You can fill this scratchpad up with information needed as you are guided below so that you can progress through this activity faster.

== Red Hat SSO - An Introduction

Red Hat SSO is used in this module to both offer single-sign on to Mobile users, and also for securing the APIs. 

[TIP]
====
We will be using OpenID Connect which is an open authentication protocol that works on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. OIDC offers a discovery mechanism called *OpenID Connect Discovery*, where an OpenID server (here Red Hat SSO based on Keycloak) publishes its metadata at a well-known URL. This URL is typically a collection of various endpoints the server offers, some of which are used in this workshop too.
====

* Launch Red Hat SSO by clicking {sso_tenant_console}[SSO Console^,window="sso"] and login using username and password ({user_name}/{user_password}).
* Click on the *OpenID Endpoint Configuration* link to view the *OpenID Provider Configuration* of Red Hat SSO.
+
.Red Hat SSO - Logged In
image::images/apim/apim-sso-login.png[]
* Here is how the *OpenID Provider Configuration* looks like
+
.Red Hat SSO - OpenID Provider Configuration
image::images/apim/well-know-openid-configuration.png[]
* We are interested specifically in the following endpoints

[cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|Endpoint | URL

| *OpenID Provider Configuration (well-known config)*: +
This URL provides a mechanism to discover the End-User's OpenID Provider and obtain information needed to interact with it, including OpenID/OAuth endpoint locations. The following endpoints is fetched from this URL |
\https://sso.{openshift_subdomain}/auth/realms/globex-{user_name}/.well-known/openid-configuration 

| *issuer*: +
This value is needed when we need to authorize a user through single sign-on |

\https://sso.{openshift_subdomain}/auth/realms/globex-{user_name} 

| *token_endpoint* : +
clients can obtain access tokens from the server using this token endpoint and use these same tokens to access protected resources (APIs in our case) |
\https://sso.{openshift_subdomain}/auth/realms/globex-{user_name}/protocol/openid-connect/token

== Design and Govern Mobile OpenAPI Specification

//API design refers to the process of developing application programming interfaces (APIs) that expose data and application functionality for use by developers and users. Red Hat API Designer, based on https://www.apicur.io/[Apicurio^], is a lightweight tool that helps you to design APIs. 

In this step you will import the draft OpenAPI specs for *Mobile App* and edit them to include *Security Schemes*. Once the API design phase is complete you will then manage that within the Red Hat Service Registry. The API Designer sessions are stateless and you must save your API definition as a JSON file at the end of each session. 


=== Section Goals

* Import a draft OpenAPI specification for Mobile App into an API Designer
* Edit the draft OpenAPI specification to add *OpenID Security Schemes* and include Red Hat SSO's OpenID Provider Configuration
* Govern the Mobile OpenAPI with Red Hat Service Registry

=== Design Mobile OpenAPI
To import the OpenAPI draft into API designer, you can import as text OR upload as file. To keep things simple in this workshop, you will import the content by simply pasting the draft spec as YAML based text into the API designer.

[NOTE]
====
In a real-world scenario you would do the inverse: start with an empty API specification, and define the different elements of the spec document. You would then export the spec in JSON or YAML format (by copying the contents from the source editor) to your local file system and push it to version control.
====


* Launch API Designer by clicking on this link {api_designer_url}[API Designer^, window=api_designer]
* Click on the *New API* button.

* You can share this OpenAPI schema with others via this OpenAPI Schema's endpoint : {service_registry_url}/apis/registry/v2/groups/globex/artifacts/mobileapi
* You can now close the Service Registry's browser tab.
* This schema can be used for generating Quarkus code for both Clients and Server-side using maven plugins. (Note that the https://github.com/rh-cloud-architecture-workshop/globex-mobile[Globex Mobile App^, window="code-samples"] is NodeJS + Angular in this module)


=== Section Outcome

* Added Security Scheme to Mobile OpenAPI with API Desginers
* Imported the Mobile OpenAPI into Service Registry to govern the API spec.
* A shareable link is available to the Mobile OpenAPI specification to be used by other teams and systems.

=== Cleanup
Please close the API Designer and Service Registry browser tabs (\^‿^) to avoid too many browser tabs

== Configure 3scale API Management to secure and manage Mobile Gateway API

The Mobile API has now been designed by API Designer, and is governed by Red Hat Service Registry. 

Let us fast forward a bit in time, and the backend developers team has built the Mobile Gateway server-side https://github.com/rh-cloud-architecture-workshop/globex-mobile-gateway[code^, window="code-samples"] built using Quarkus. This service has been pre-deployed under the `module-apim-{user_name}` namespace on OpenShift. 


In this section you will manage and secure the Mobile Gateway API endpoints so that the Mobile App can access them securely. To create these API endpoints, and secure and manage them, we will need to configure them on 3scale API management. 

=== Section Goals 

* setup Red Hat SSO to provide single sign-on (SSO) capabilities for users signing into Mobile App 
* setup Red Hat SSO to secure Mobile Gateway API endpoints using OpenID Connect
* manage Mobile Gateway APIs with Red Hat 3scale API Management
* access Red Hat 3scale API Management's Developer Portal as a Mobile Developer to sign up for access of API

=== Red Hat SSO
3scale integrates with Red Hat SSO for authenticating the API requests using the OpenID Connect specification. On signing-up, External/Mobile developers  will be provided with client credentialsto access to the APIs securely. This client credentials is synced between 3scale and the Red Hat Single Sign-On server using a component know an *Zync*

In order to setup OpenID Connect, you will now create a special *client id* meant for *Client Credentials Management*

* Click to launch {sso_tenant_console}[Red Hat SSO^, window="sso"] and login using username and password ({user_name}/{user_password}).
* Click on *Clients* from the left-hand navigation. And, then click on the *Create* button on the right side as shown below

+
.Red Hat SSO: Clients listing
image::images/apim/client-add.png[]

* In the *Add Client* wizard, enter the following details, and click on the *Save* button.

[width=60%]
|====
| Name | Value

|Client Id | `client-manager`
|Client Protocol (dropdown) | `openid-connect`
|====

.Red Hat SSO: Add Client wizard
image::images/apim/client-manager.png[]


*  You will be shown the *Settings* tab of `client-manager` client.
+
.Red Hat SSO: View *client-manager* Settings
image::images/apim/new-client-save.png[]

* Configure this `client-manager` as follows (refer to screenshot below) so that 3scale can synchronize with Red Hat SSO 
** Change *Access Type* to `Confidential`
** Once the Access Types is Confidential you will see a new toggle button *Service Accounts Enabled*
** Keep *Service Accounts Enabled* as ON, and turn all other Grants and Flow OFF to match the following screenshot.
+
This configuration allows only Services based access using Service Accounts, and will be used by 3scale API Management system in the next steps, when mobile users sign up for access. Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a regular user's credentials.
+
.Red Hat SSO: Configure client-manager
image::images/apim/client-manager-setting.png[]

* Click on *Save* button at the bottom of the page. You will be notified that the changes are saved successfully. +

.Red Hat SSO: Save client-manager settings
image::images/apim/client-manager-save.png[]

* Now you will need to setup *Client Roles* for this client id, so that it can manage other clients (create, amend and delete) on behalf of 3scale API Management
** Click on the *Service Account Roles* tab from the top tab navigation.
** From the *Client Roles* dropdown, choose `realm-management`
+
.Red Hat SSO: setup Service Account Roles for *client-manager* in Service Account Roles tab
image::images/apim/sso-service-acc-tab.png[]
* From the *Available Roles* multichoice field, choose `manage-clients`, and click on *Add selected >>* button
** The mappings will get auto-saved.
+
.Red Hat SSO: Add manage-clients roles
image::images/apim/client-realm-management.png[]

* You can view the credentials of this client-id from the *Credentials* tab. You will need this when setting up the 3scale products +
** Now is a good time to save this in your Dev Spaces Scratchpad. (Ctrl+P > scratchpad.txt to open the file from within Dev Spaces tab)

=== Create Mobile Gateway Backend, Product and ActiveDoc on 3scale

To integrate and manage the Mobile Gateway API in 3scale, you need to create Products and Backend

.[.underline]#*[Click to know] What are Backend, Product, ActiveDocs and CRDs?*#
[%collapsible]
====

* *Backends* are Internal APIs which are then bundled into a 3scale Product. 
** it contains at least the URL of the API
** It can optionally be configured with mapping rules, methods and metrics to facilitate reusability.
* *Products* are the Customer-facing APIs. 
** It defines the application plans, and configure APIcast
** You can create API documentation by attaching the Mobile OpenAPI schema as a *3scale ActiveDoc*
* *ActiveDocs* are interactive documentation for your API offered as a framework by 3scale. 
** With Swagger 2.0 (based on the Swagger Spec) this provides a functional, attractive documentation for the API, which will help developers to explore, to test and integrate with the APIs.
* A CRD file allows you to define your own object kinds (Backend, API, ActiveDoc etc) and lets the API Server handle the entire lifecycle of the objects.
====

In this workshop you will be using the *3scale Operator* that creates and maintains 3scale on OpenShift with custom resource definitions (CRDs).  

==== Create 3scale Backend for Mobile Gateway service
To create the Backend for Mobile Gateway, you will need the Service URL of Mobile Gateway deployment running on OpenShift.

.[.underline]#*[Click to know] What is a Service?*#
[%collapsible]
====
In OpenShift, a Kubernetes Service serves as an internal load balancer and identifies pods which in turn have the applications. If the application needs to be accessed from outside of OpenShift, you will need OpenShift routes. +
In this workshop, since both 3scale and the Mobile Gateway run on OpenShift, 3scale will proxy requests to the backend using Services. This also means the backend cannot be accessed directly from outside OpenShift.
====


* Navigate to the *Dev Spaces browser tab* you have launched at the beginning of this module
** If this browser tab is not open, click on {devspaces_dashboard}/dashboard/#/ide/devspaces-{user_name}/cloud-architecture-workshop[Dev Spaces IDE^, window="devspaces"] and login with ({user_name}/{user_password}).
* Navigate to the folder `workshop -> module-apim -> mobile -> gateway` and open the `mobile-gateway-backend.yaml` file. (Shortcut: `Ctrl+P > mobile-gateway-backend.yaml`)

=== Section Outcome
* 3scale Backend, Product, ActiveDocs and Users were created
* Developer Portal was setup for public access without Access Code
* Signed for an Application as a Mobile Developer
* Patched Red Hat SSO Web Origin so that the calls from Globex Mobile App will not cause errors

== Test Mobile Application 

In the previous section, you signed up for access as a Mobile Developer and gained credentials to access the Globex Mobile Gateway API. In this section you will complete Mobile App configuration and test this out

[NOTE]
====
As part of this workshop, you will use a mobile-friendly Angular App and not a mobile-native app. So no mobile app installation is necessary. This Mobile App is work in progress and at present shows only categories and products within each category.
====

The Mobile Application can be access via this QR Code as well as via browser

* Scan the following QR Code with your mobile phone
+
.Scan to view Mobile App
image::https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=300x300&amp;cht=qr&amp;chl=https://globex-mobile-globex-apim-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}[Globex Mobile,200,300]
 
* Alternatively, launch https://globex-mobile-globex-apim-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}[Globex Mobile^] and login using (asilva/openshift)
* The login process may take a few seconds. Please wait for bit :)
+
.User is logged in
image::images/apim/apim-mobile-loggedin.png[width=40%]
* After logging in, click on the *View the categories* button. You will view on a list of Categories available
+
.Categories view
image::images/apim/mobile-categories.png[width=40%]
* Click on the 'Clothing' category to view the Product Listing.
* Try out a few more categories too which will help us to generate some traffic to view in the Analytics section.


=== Analytics
* Navigate to the {globex_developer_portal}/buyer/stats[Globex Developer Portal Statistics^, window="devportal"] 
* From the dropdown indicated in this screenshot, choose the Mobile Gateway API's application plan (which is  `basic-plan` in this case).
* You will be presented with the statistics graph of the calls made to this gateway by the Partner Developer's access.
+
image::images/apim/apim-mobile-analytics.png[]

=== Under the hood
As part of this Section you tried out the Mobile App. 



* The user *asilva* you logged into the Mobile App as, is authenticated using Red Hat SSO.
* Once the user logs in, a token is generated by Red Hat SSO using the Client ID, SSO Authority details that you passed to the Mobile App to setup the configuration
* This token is authenticated by 3scale to ensure the Client ID indeed has access to that particular API
* The token is also passed onto the backend service running on OpenShift, which checks for validity of the token. 
* The https://github.com/rh-cloud-architecture-workshop/globex-mobile-gateway/blob/main/src/main/java/org/globex/gateway/mobile/rest/MobileCatalogResource.java[REST endpoints^, window="code-samples"] is supplied with the SSO URL information as part of the https://github.com/rh-cloud-architecture-workshop/globex-mobile-gateway/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties, window="code-samples"]
* The endpoints are protected with @Authenticated which in this case looks for a valid token being present.
+
.REST endpoint is annotated with @Authenticated
image::images/apim/mobile_rest_java.png[width=80%]

With that we wrap up the activities *Design, Govern, Manage, Secure* Globex Mobile Gateway APIs for access from the Mobile Application securely.

Coming up next: We will setup the Globex Partner APIs for access by external Partner portals.


[NOTE] 
=====
If you are running out time, now is a good time to switch to a different module. 

The Partner Portal section is quite similar to the Mobile App but for the fact that the Partner Users are not managed by Red Hat SSO. Therefore Partner Portal authenticates itself using the *Client Credentials* method using a client ID and secret. The authentication is only through the backend services of the Partner Portal without users getting into the picture.
=====

{empty} +

=== Cleanup
You can now close all the tabs except for this Instructions and Dev Spaces browser tabs. Close all files open within Dev Spaces as well.

If you choose to proceed to another module, close all but this *Instructions* browser before starting the next module. Go back to the link:workshop-goals[*Overview Page*] to choose your next module.

== Setup Partner Gateway and Partner Web App (Optional)

Before we start this section, close all the browser tabs except for this *Instructions tab* and *Dev Spaces* tab. This will help you navigate this section more easily.

Since we've gone through the Design and Governance sections of the Mobile API, in this section we will skip the design section. We'll also keep discussions to only essentials :)

=== Publish Partner API to Service Registry

* If you don't have a browser tab open with OpenShift Dev Spaces, click on {devspaces_dashboard}/dashboard/#/ide/devspaces-{user_name}/cloud-architecture-workshop[Dev Spaces IDE^, window="devspaces"]. If needed login with your username and password ({user_name}/{user_password}).
* In Dev Spaces, navigate to the folder `workshop -> module-apim -> partner -> activedoc`, and open the file `partner-activedoc-draft.json`. 
** Or type [Ctrl+P] and type the file name as `partner-activedoc-draft.json`

== Test Partner Web Application 

In the previous section, you signed up for access as a Partner Developer and gained credentials to access the Globex PArtner Gateway API. You also setup the necessary configurations for the Partner Web Application.


* Launch the https://globex-partner-web-globex-apim-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}[Globex Partner Web^]
+
.Partner Web Portal

* Login using username/password as *(partner/openshift)*. 
** It is notable that the partner users are not managed using Red Hat SSO. 
* After logging in, the entire product list is shown in a paginated format.
** Allow a few seconds for the catalogue to load
* Reload this page by hitting the Browser Refresh a few times which will help us to generate some analytics.

=== Under the hood
As part of this Section you setup and tested the Partner Web App. 

* The user *partner* that you logged into the Partner App as, is not authenticated using Red Hat SSO. In fact it is not authenticated at all. 
** This is because the way partners handle user authentication is not something that Globex is concerned about at all.
* In this scenario we use Client Credentials authentication, because the backend NodeJS server authenticates itself with Client ID and Credentials obtained by the Partner Developer while signing up for an Application via 3scale Developer Portal
* The token generated by NodeJS is then exchanged with 3scale to ensure the Client ID indeed has access to that particular API

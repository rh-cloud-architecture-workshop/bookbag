== Overview of activities

Here is an outline of the activities you will achieve as part of this module.

* Gain understanding of what has been already setup for you
* Deploy the Quarkus Knative Services needed for the solution
* Build an event mesh with OpenShift Serverless Eventing components
* Try out the solution end-to-end to see how data flows through the various systems and services

== Deployment overview and introduction

The initial topology will look like this of the `globex-serverless-%user_name%` namespace on which you will be working on looks like this.

* In a browser window, navigate to the OpenShift console at %openshift_cluster_console%. If needed, login with your username and password (%user_name%/%user_password%). +
If this is the first time you open the console, you will be directed to the Developer Perspective of the console, which shows you the different namespaces you have access to.
+
image::images/serverless/serverless-openshift-landing.png[]
** `globex-serverless-%user_name%` namespace contains the components you will be working on in this lab
** `globex-gitops-%user_name%` namespace contains the ArgoCD elements for GitOps. This is described in detail in the *Introduction* module.
** `globex-mw-%user_name%` contains Middleware deployments including AMQ Streams (Apache Kafka)
** `globex-%user_name%` namespace contains other services the application is dependent on. This is described in detail in the *Introduction* module.

* Click on the `globex-serverless-%user_name%` namespace link to select the namespace you are going to use in this lab, and select `Topology` from the left menu.
* The *Topology* view displays the components that have been setup for you already. Note that this screenshot shows the topology after the components have been moved around to be displayed well here.
+
image::images/serverless/serverless-namespace-initial-toplogy.png[]
* Let us look at a few of the current components. The rest of the components are discussed in the next sections
+
[cols="20%,80%"]
|===
|*Component* | *Function*
| globex-web        | This is a _NodeJS + Angular_ web application which serves as the front end website. This app relies on the core services deployed in the globex-%user_name% namespace and the `product-reviews` services described below
| product-reviews   | This Quarkus based service is a backend for the `globex-web` web application. 
| reviews-db        | Postgresql DB to store the reviews once they are moderated. 
| serverless-kafka-secret | For the purpose of this workshop, this job copies the Kafka credentials (`kafka-secret` Secret) into the current globex-serverless-%user_name% namespace.
|===


=== Red Hat AMQ Streams setup overview 

* Red Hat Streams based on Apache Kafka has been setup for you already. The Kafka broker is installed in the globex-mw-%user_name% namespace. In the same namespace, Kafdrop, a tool to introspect a Kafka broker is also installed.
* Click %kafdrop_url%[Kafdrop^, window="others"] to navigate to the Kafdrop home page.
* Notice that there are 3 topics which are relevant to this module. Here is what each of these topics are meant for:
+
[cols="25%,75%",]
|===
| *Kafka Topic* | *Function*
| globex.reviews     | When a user submits a review, that review is produced to this topic with Knative Eventing framework.
| reviews.moderated  | Reviews which are moderated are produced to this topic to be further persisted in a database.
| reviews.sentiment  | Holds the reviews after analysis with a sentiment score.
|===

=== Introducing OpenShift Serverless for event-driven architecture

When a user submits a *product review* from the Globex website, the destination for the review is Red Hat AMQ Streams (Apache Kafka). Similarly there are a number of other services which are involved in this solution which produce and consume Kafka messages to moderate and analyse these reviews in (close to) real-time. To make it easier to build out such an event-driven architecture we introduce OpenShift Serverless (based on Knative Eventing). 

The services which will need to be Kafka Clients and Producers, now need to only use HTTP. Knative Eventing uses standard HTTP requests to send and receive events between these event producers and sinks. These events must conform to the CloudEvents specifications, which enables creating, parsing, sending, and receiving events in any programming language.


.[.underline]#*[Click to know] What is CloudEvent?*#
[%collapsible]
====
https://cloudevents.io[CloudEvent^] is a specification for describing event data in a common way. An event includes context and data about an occurrence. Each occurrence is uniquely identified by the data of the event. Each occurrence is uniquely identified by the data of the event. The headers within a CloudEvent helps Knative Eventing to route the events to the right destination.
====


== Deploy Knative Services

As a first step, let us ensure all the services are created. A few of the services are predeployed in your OpenShift cluster. These services are built using the Knative Serving framework. +

.[.underline]#*[Click to know] What is Knative Serving?*#
[%collapsible]
====
OpenShift Serverless, with Knative Serving, makes it easy to define and control how serverless workload behaves on the Kubernetes cluster. With just one Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) all the primary resources (Services, Routes, Configurations, and Revisions) are created and managed. Knative Serving supports rapid deployment of serverless containers, autoscaling, including scaling pods down to zero.
====

* There are 3 Knative Services that are used in this solution
+
[cols="30%,80%"]
|===
|*Service name* | *Function*
| aiml-moderate-reviews   | Checks if the product reviews are acceptable or abusive, and assigns a score (0 or 1) accordingly. The reviews with a score are sent to `reviews.moderated` topic,
| aiml-sentiment-reviews  | Analyses the product reviews and creates a new message with a sentiment score; The reviews with a sentiment score are sent to `reviews.sentiment` topic. This service is predeployed.
| persist-reviews         | Persists all moderated reviews to a Postgresql database. You will deploy this service in the next steps.
|===

* Navigate to the OpenShift Console's Administrator view, and go to *Serverless > Serving* menu. You will see that two of the above mentioned services have been already deployed (`aiml-moderate-reviews` and `aiml-sentiment-reviews`). +
In the next step, you will create the `persist-reviews` Knative service using a CRD.
+
image::images/serverless/serverless-2knative-services.png[]

* Create `persist-reviews`: Click on the *Create* button highlighted in the screenshot above. Choose *Create > Service* option. Replace all existing content with the following YAML file, and click on *Save*

* Navigate back to the %openshift_cluster_console%/topology/ns/globex-serverless-%user_name%?view=graph[Developer > Topology, window="console", target="console"] view of the `globex-serverless-%user_name%` namespace and you will notice all the three Knative services
+
image::images/serverless/3knative-service.png[]
* A few interesting points to notes with the newly created `persist-reviews` 
** This service is shown with a dark blue colour because of the annotation `autoscaling.knative.dev/min-scale: "1"` added in the YAML while creation of this service. This means a minimum of one pod is running all the time, instead of it scaling down to zero (0) like the other two services.
** With just providing the container image, Knative Serving creates all the other needed Kubernetes resources (Services, Routes, Configurations, and Revisions) - making it easier for developers to create such services quickly.

== Connect Knative Services to Kafka using Knative Eventing

In this section we will connect the Knative Services (refer to previous section) to Kafka using *Knative Sink* and *SinkBinding*. 

.[.underline]#*[Click to know]  What is Knative Sink and SinkBinding ?*#
[%collapsible]
====
* A https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/1.30/eventing/event-sinks/serverless-kafka-developer-sink.html[Kafka Sink for Apache Kafka^] helps in persisting the incoming Kafka message (CloudEvent) to a configurable Apache Kafka topic. Event producers (such as apps, devices) can send CloudEvents over HTTP to the Kafka Sinks there by reducing the complexity of new protocols and message formats for app developers. The Kafka Sinks then send the CloudEvents they receive to the configured Apache Kafka topic. 
* https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/1.30/eventing/event-sources/serverless-custom-event-sources.html[SinkBinding^] supports decoupling the source (service which produces events) from the actual sink. The SinkBinding object injects environment variables (such as sink URL) into the services there by decoupling the source from the sink.
====

=== Create Sink and SinkBinding

This solution needs a number of Sinks and SinkBinding for the various Kafka topics described in an earlier section. You will create one of them here, while the others have been preconfigured for you.

Here is a visual of how the reviews flows from the User to Kafka with Knative eventing. 

* The reviews submitted by the user are sent to the `product_reviews` Quarkus service through HTTP POST.
* The `product_reviews` service sends this review as a CloudEvent to the `reviews-sink` Kafka Sink over _HTTP_.
* The Quarkus service remains agnostic to the internals of the Kafka streaming platform.
* The  `reviews-sink` Kafka Sink sends this Cloud Event to the `globex.reviews` Kafka topic.

image::images/serverless/reviews-keventing-kafka.png[]

Now, go ahead and create the *Sink and SinkBinding*.

* Click on the *(+)* icon found on top of the OpenShift Console to access the *Import YAML* wizard.

image::images/serverless/console-add-yaml.png[]

* Copy the following CRD into the *Import YAML* form, and click *Create* to create the KafkaSink `reviews-sink` which will send messages to `globex.reviews` Kafka Topic.

+
[cols="25%,75"]
|===
|*Sink name* | *Function*
| reviews-sink            | Send the reviews submitted by user (HTTP POST from `globex-web` app to `product-reviews` Quarkus service) as CloudEvents to `globex.reviews` Kafka topic
| moderated-reviews-sink  | Sends reviews *moderated* by the `aiml-moderate-reviews` service to topic `reviews.moderated`
| reviews-sentiment-sink  | Sends sentiment score of reviews by the `aiml-sentiment-reviews` service to topic `reviews.sentiment`
|===

=== Create Knative Broker and Triggers

The next step is to setup the Knative components that can invoke the HTTP endpoint of the services (`aiml-moderate-reviews`, `aiml-sentiment-reviews` & `persist-reviews`) whenever a new event occurs due to a product review being submitted. This is performed by using the components Knative Source, Broker and Triggers. +

.[.underline]#*[Click to know]  What is Knative Source, Broker and Triggers?*#
[%collapsible]
[INFO]
====
* KafkaSource reads messages in existing Apache Kafka topics, and sends those messages (CloudEvents format) a Knative Broker for Kafka.
* Brokers provide a discoverable endpoint for incoming event, and use Triggers for event delivery. 
* A Trigger subscribes to events from a specific broker, filters them based on CloudEvents headers, and delivers them to a Knative service's HTTP endpoint.
====

==== Create Knative Broker
* Click on the *(+)* icon found on top of the OpenShift Console to access the *Import YAML* wizard.
* Copy the following YAML (CRD)  and click *Create* to create a  Knative broker. +
Note: There is just one broker for the entire solution, which will use triggers to route them to the right services thereby building a realtime event mesh.

* Copy the following YAML to create a Knative KafkaSource. +
Note that this KafkaSource reads from the specific four (4) topics that is defined in the YAML below, and refers to the `globex-broker` you created in the previous step.

==== Create Knative triggers
You will now create triggers which will invoke the HTTP endpoint of Knative services depending on the CloudEvent headers. +
Each CloudEvent created will be tagged with specific values in the headers `ce-type` and `ce-source` which is then used by the Trigger to route them to the correct service HTTP endpoint

* Click on the *(+)* icon found on top of the OpenShift Console to access the *Import YAML* wizard.
* Copy and paste the following CRD to create the 3 Triggers matching the 3 Knative services

* In the OpenShift *Developer> Topology* view, you will also notice that the Knative services have all turned fully blue because they have been triggered by the reviews submission and so have scaled up. +
In a few seconds two of them (except `persist-reviews`) will go back to a white ring denoting that they have been scaled down to zero since they are not in use anymore.
+
image::images/serverless/reviews-knative-services.png[]

* Now, go ahead and leave review comments of as many products as you like. If you are feeling adventurous you can try a few inappropriate comments too to see how they are being moderated ;)

=== Under the hood: Step through Review moderation flow

* Click %kafdrop_url%[Kafdrop^, window="others"] to navigate to the Kafdrop home page. Enter *reviews* in the Name filter as shown below. You can see 3 topics here.

* Click on the `globex.reviews` topic to see an Overview of the topic page
+
image::images/serverless/globex-reviews-topic-overview.png[]
* Click on the Partition [0] as shown above to view a listing of the reviews you submitted.
+
image::images/serverless/globex-reviews-topic-list.png[]
* Click on (>) shown against a message (as shown in screenshot) to view the complete message
+
image::images/serverless/globex-reviews-topic-detail.png[]
* Note the headers of the message. This is what each of them mean
** *ce_id: 1* -  This is a unique id for each message. 
** *ce_source: submit-review* and *ce_type: submit-review-event* - These are the primary values which are used by the Knative triggers to route the message to the right Knative service.
* Navigate back to the %openshift_cluster_console%/topology/ns/globex-serverless-%user_name%?view=graph[Topology View^, window="console"], to view the corresponding mapping in the Knative Broker and Triggers
** Click on the blue link (highlighted in blue below) pointing to `aiml-moderate-reviews` service. This link represents the `moderate-reviews-trigger`. 
** The right-hand panel shows the trigger's *source* = _submit-review_ and *type*	= _submit-review-event_. 
** You will note that this matches the CloudEvent headers in the Kafka message that you viewed in Kafdrop message browser. 
** This is how the Knative Triggers match the messages to the right endpoint.
+
image::images/serverless/moderate-reviews-trigger.png[]
* Once the reviews are sent to the `aiml-moderate-reviews` (Python) service, it uses the https://huggingface.co/Hate-speech-CNERG/english-abusive-MuRIL[Hate-speech-CNERG/english-abusive-MuRIL AI/ML model^, window="others"] to identify if the product review is abusive or not.
** A score of `-1` is assigned if the review is acceptable or `0` if the comment is abusive. Here is a sample message of how a moderated review looks like
+
image::images/serverless/moderate-review-score.png[]
** This service then POSTs the review with the score to the `moderated-reviews-sink` (with the help of the ServiceBinding which binds the sink to the services). This sink is configured to write to the `reviews.moderated` topic
+
image::images/serverless/moderated-reviews-sink.png[]

* The message sent to `moderated-reviews-sink` topic is now sent to the `persist-reviews` Quarkus service through the `persist-reviews-trigger` trigger. This service then persists the review in a Postgresql DB if the score less than `0` (that is, the review is acceptable)
** Note that the trigger's filter's source and type matches the ce_type and ce_source headers of the message from the `reviews.moderated` topic shown in the screenshot above.
+
image::images/serverless/persist-reviews-trigger.png[]

=== Under the hood:  Review sentiment analysis
The Review sentiment analysis flow is quite similar to the Moderate Review flow. 

image::images/serverless/review-sentiment-flow.png[]

* The `sentiment-reviews-trigger` responds to the same CloudEvent filter headers as the `moderate-reviews-trigger`; this is because when a review is submitted, they need to be processed by both the moderate and analyse services.
+
image::images/serverless/sentiment-reviews-trigger.png[width=80%]
* The `aiml-sentiment-reviews` which is invoked, then uses the https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment[nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, window="others"] to identify a score (from -1 to 4) depending on the tone of the review.
* The review is then sent to the %kafdrop_url%/topic/reviews.sentiment[Kafdrop:reviews.sentiment topic^, window="others"]. Click on the link Partition `0` to view the sentiment score.
+
image::images/serverless/sentiment-score.png[]
** As a next step, this sentiment score can be used to build a dashboard to visualise the sentiment of various categories of products.
